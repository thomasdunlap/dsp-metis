# Write a Markov text generator, [markov.py](python/markov.py).
# Your program should be called from the command line with two arguments:
# the name of a file containing text to read, and the number of words to generate.
# For example, if `chains.txt` contains the short story by Frigyes Karinthy,
# we could run:

# ```bash
# ./markov.py chains.txt 40
# ```

# A possible output would be:

# > show himself once more than the universe and what I often catch myself playing
# our well-connected game went on. Our friend was absolutely correct: nobody from
# the group needed this way. We never been as the Earth has the network of eternity.

# There are design choices to make; feel free to experiment and shape the program
# as you see fit. Jeff Atwood's [Markov and You](http://blog.codinghorror.com/markov-and-you/)
# is a fun place to get started learning about what you're trying to make.
