### Q1.  Cheat Sheet of Commands  

Here's a list of items with which you should be familiar:  
* show current working directory path
* creating a directory
* deleting a directory
* creating a file using `touch` command
* deleting a file
* renaming a file
* listing hidden files
* copying a file from one directory to another

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do.  (Use the 8 items above and add a couple of your own.)  

1. `pwd`: show current working directory path
2. `mkdir`: creating a directory
3. `rmdir`: deleting a directory
4. `touch`: creating a file using `touch` command
5. `rm`: deleting a file
6. `mv`: renaming a file
7. `ls`: listing hidden files
8. `cp`: copying a file from one directory to another
9. `cd`: change directory
10. `curl`: getting and sending URL info; technically cURL.
11. `cd ..`: navigate up one directory
12. `man`: pull up the manual for some-cmd
13. `find . -name foo`: find files in the current directory (and children) that
  have blah in their name
